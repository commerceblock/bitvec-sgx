/*! Bit management

The `BitStore` trait defines constants and associated functions suitable for
managing the bit patterns of a fundamental, and is the constraint for the
storage type of the data structures of the rest of the crate.

The other types in this module provide stronger rules about how indices map to
concrete bits in fundamental elements. They are implementation details, and are
not exported in the prelude.

This trait must only be implemented on unsigned integer primitives with full
alignment. It cannot be implemented on `u128` on any architecture, or on `u64`
on 32-bit systems.

The `Sealed` supertrait ensures that this can only be implemented locally, and
